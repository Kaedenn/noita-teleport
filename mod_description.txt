BEWARE SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

"I need to visit a Holy Mountain." "Did I collapse that Holy Mountain?" "Did I get that orb?" "Where is that orb?"

(Feb 14th release; does not have beta content).

This mod lets you teleport to the following locations:
Temples.
Bosses.
Orbs (yes, even the randomly-placed ones).
Your current position, to the east.
Your current position, to the west.
Your current position, but back to the center.
Places of interest: spells, items, wands, portals, portal rooms, the Friend cave, and more!

Key features:
* Teleport to any orb in any run. Feedback on whether or not you've collected that orb.
* Teleport to any Holy Mountain. Feedback on whether or not the given mountain has collapsed (only works in New Game).
* Teleport to any boss.
* Teleport to the east or to the west.
* Teleport to the the Friend, wherever he happens to be.
* Teleport to any portal room.
* Teleport to static spells, wands, and items.
* Teleport to celestial bodies.
* Teleport to spawn and the altar.
* Teleport to the cauldron (requires Disable Mod Restrictions; you can download that via the official Discord).

Known bugs and planned changes:
* The "Vault" Holy Mountain teleports you into a wall. This will be fixed in a future release. Use "The Work" instead.
* The "Snowy Depths" Holy Mountain occasionally teleports you just barely above the correct location. This isn't high enough to anger the Gods, but it is sometimes annoying.
* Temple collapse feedback only works for New Game. Feedback for non-New Game temples is planned, but requires quite a bit of work.
* No feedback for whether or not you've collected corrupted orbs. This is planned.

Comments welcome!
